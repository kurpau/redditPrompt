    "content": "So I've been working two jobs for a little over a year now. A full time and a part time. Full time reduced my hours and I can't work more at the other job. It's now getting to the point that I can't afford my bills and I'm starting to worry. \n\nAfter taxes I make about $2600 a month. My rent is $1250, I pay $100 a month for my phone, another $100 for insurance, and another $1100 in CC and loan payments. Also roughly $200 for gas and $300 for groceries.\n\nAt this point I'm over my income by a few hundred bucks and I literally have nothing extra for emergencies. I'm getting deeper into debt by having to use my credit cards as well to cover gas and groceries when I need to. \n\nAt this point is it better to attempt bankruptcy or just stop paying certain bills? If I get sued for garnishment how much do you think they'll take out of my check?  \n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

First off, the headline should be: \"I have 27K in loan debt (CC and otherwise) what do I do?\" This is your critical issue. Look at that budget you laid out, and notice how without the loans, you have a healthy surplus. \n\nThe only way to get to that point is to have some very unhealthy spending habits in the first place. So until that is addressed, you're stuck. \n\n- absolutely no eating out. If you haven't tried \"intermittent fasting\" yet, you'll want to look into that purely for cost savings. Your calories for the foreseeable future should come from mostly rice and beans. Learn how to make those tasty because you really can't afford much else. \n\n- if you're looking for a reason to quit any habits like drinking or smoking/vaping, this is a big one. Those are very expensive habits. \n\n- if one of those loans is an expensive car, see if you can sell it without losing even more money and get a very used car with hopefully better gas mileage instead.\n\n- drop all of your entertainment subscriptions (e.g. steaming services) except one to keep you sane. Drop your internet plan to the cheapest plan and your data plan to the cheapest, or switch to some garbage provider like cricket to save money. \n\n- start working out if you aren't already. This seems like a weird tip, but if you live in the US, health problems can be very expensive to fix, but very cheap to prevent. \n\nAnd last, be honest with your friends and family if you are invited to an outing that costs money. \"Sorry guys, I fucked up and I need to be a bit safer with how I spend money. Thank you though!\"",

Would need to know loan balances, interest rates, and a full breakdown of your entire budget.  Bankruptcy isn't a magic cure all.  And it's not free.  You have to pay to file bankruptcy.  So it doesn't always make sense for people, because they may pay as much for bankruptcy as they owe on their debts to begin with.",
